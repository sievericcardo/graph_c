# Graphs in C

In this repository I want to focus on creation of graphs in the C programming Language. I'll try to be as consistent as possible. Also, I'll try to ensure a sort of OOP programmaing paradigm with the use of structures and pointers to emulate the concept of **objects** in C. The data will be created with `void*` elements to make them generic.
